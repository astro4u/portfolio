                I'm 26 years old and currently based in Atlanta, Georgia. I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in
                Physics, concentrating in Astrophysics. For the past six years, I have worked as a consultant in data quality, a role that's given me
                valuable professional experience. Recently, however, I took a step back and realized that my true passion lies in creating things. Whether 
                it's through my hobbies or personal projects, I'm always drawn to the process of building and bringing ideas to life.
