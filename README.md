# About this project
Hello! This is my portfolio page that houses all of my project and links to relevant social media. It also can serve as a resume of sorts. It is a work in progress
and I am building it all from scratch out using JavaScript, HTML, and TailwindCSS. I appreciate any help as I am a beginner!


## TODO
- Figure out background design - can't just be one solid color.
- Make website responsive.
- Fix visual glitch with menu items on tablet.
- Add section titles on the side.
- Add Contact Me section
- Maybe a new font?
- New color scheme perhaps... light/dark mode.
